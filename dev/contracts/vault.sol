    vault.sol
    Created by Zefram Lou (Zebang Liu) as part of the WikiGit project.

    This file implements the DASP's vault, or in other words the manager
    of the DAP's funds. It allows for the delayed withdrawl of ethers
    and/or ERC20 tokens (the delay prevents malicious withdrawls), and
    giving people who donate ethers to the vault custom tokens in return.
    The latter function can be used to implement things like ICOs and
    honorary tokens (such as the unicorn token), and more.
